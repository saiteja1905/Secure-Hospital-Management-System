We believe the existing hospital systemâ€™s performance might eventually decay due to their manual, time-consuming
management, and maintenance, which are becoming highly inefficient due to the increasing population of people visiting the
hospital. Often, the data is incomplete or does not follow adequate administration standards. The principal purpose of our
proposed system is to achieve a paperless hospital service. We are focusing on maintaining low-cost, reliable automation of
the existing system. Embedded functionalities are designed to furnish improved customer service, reduce process costs,
streamline the search of medical records, bills, patients, doctors, etc. The system lays out excellent security of information at
every layer of the user system interaction to ensure data confidentiality and two protect patient privacy. Additionally, we will
prepare the system with features to defend against security attacks like SQLIA, DOS, etc. The closing output is to bring forth
a secure hospital service system that will satisfy numerous functional requirements, by implementing robust security designs
like Session management, Certificate authorization, data masking, etc, within a reasonable time frame.
